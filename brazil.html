  <h1>Brazil</b></h1>

  <p>Brazil encompasses around half of South America’s landmass, making it the largest country on the continent. Because it’s so large, it’s not surprising that it is made up of a wide variety of landscapes, coastlines, and experiences.

  Wildlife lovers can explore the wetlands and the rainforest, while city lovers can wander the streets of Rio. Along with beautiful beaches, one of the world’s best soccer teams, and the world-famous Carnival celebration, Brazil is truly a melting pot, perfect for every kind of traveler.

  The minute you land, you will be taken aback by the country of color and life, one of old and new history, and you will never want to leave.</p>
